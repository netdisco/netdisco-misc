Release Instructions - Netdisco

These is a rough outline of the netdisco release procedure.
The release mechanism is make controlled.  Please add to this
document and commit back if you find any discrepancies.

To start: Create a new directory (I call it package/) and copy the
RELEASE_Makefile to Makefile.  Or just `ln -s RELEASE_Makefile Makefile` and
use this dir.  Next check out the mibs and netdisco pacakges from a developer
login.  Never trust the anon servers.

Next run 'make version' and 'make mib-ver' to make sure the makefile is
behaving properly.

The distribution has only what's in CVS plus some generated
documentation.

Then follow the next steps.

PREP:
    0.  double check version number in netdisco and netdisco.pm
        Remove -cvs
    1.  cvs update / commit to sync all devel versions
    2.  Vi update README.pod, UPGRADE.pod, INSTALL.pod in doc/

    10. Double check all contents of the dist files for extra junk
        Especially temp files, files created automatically, dot-files
    11. Do a test install / beta testers, update INSTALL.pod and README.pod
        at least once then go back to #0 :-/
