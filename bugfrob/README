This tool uses the xml_export tool from the Sourceforge adocman
project:
http://sitedocs.sourceforge.net/projects/adocman/xml_export.html

To install adocman, download it (current version as of June, 2008
is the March, 2005 0.13 release) from the Sourceforge download
page:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=52614
For some reason, Sourceforge doesn't include a Makefile.PL to install
the Alexandria package; you can get mine from
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/ports/devel/adocman/files/Makefile.PL

Download the Makefile.PL to the source directory, and do the
usual perl Makefile.PL to install it.  Also install the
dependencies:
libwww
HTML::Parser
Crypt::SSLeay
Digest::MD5
Term::ReadKey

Install the binaries -- adocman, atracker and xml_export.  This
package doesn't need atracker but you might as well install it.

Then, run

adocman --login --username=(sf username) --interactive

to get a cookie, and then "make" should get you the processed
bug stuff.

Make sure you type in your password properly.  adocman --login
behaves the same way on success and failure, except on failure
it doesn't set the right cookies.
